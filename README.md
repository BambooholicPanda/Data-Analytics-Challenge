# Data-Analytics-Challenge
##### Data Analytics Challenge of the Le Wagon workshop "Data Analytics with Python Sprint", taken on Oct 23, 2022.

This workshop, by Le Wagon's teacher **Katarzyna Kupczyk**, took us through the basics of Data Analytics with Python. 
I decided to take the workshop in order to get a first glance of what the world of Big Data is like. 

I am currently taking *Keepcoding*'s **IT Bootcamp**, which is *sponsored by Glovo* and seeks to instruct +200 women in Fullstack Development and Big Data (we choose one among both paths).
In this **challenge** we used **pandas, seaborn** and **pyplot**. It was a very interesting exercise that made my jaw drop! #BigData is cool! :-)
